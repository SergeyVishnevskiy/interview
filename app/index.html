                                then the workload increased, and we decided to remain in the ranks of the participants

                                shelled from time to time here, too! There's the “gray zone” just 40 km from Mariupol.”

                                going anywhere. I'll stay at home." I thought my parents started panicking way too
                                early, as usual.

                        went to the fire by our apartment building. If it was already lit, I had to boil some water. As
