                        We have a live video chat with Maksym during his working day. He appears in the red uniform of
                        the Red Cross, occasionally gets calls on the radio, and keeps on controlling the situation
                        around from the corner of his eye, directing newly arrived adults to register and catching
                        children going for a walk, “where they're not allowed to walk".

                        We were lucky: there are no air raid alert sirens, so we record the interview on the first try.
                        Maksym jokes and chuckles a lot, telling his short stories. One of them is about his “rightly
                        colored little car” as yellow as the identifying tape on the sleeves of the Ukrainian Army
                        soldiers. Another one describes his first bed in the Red Cross base, a pretentiously designed
                        green sofa under a floral wedding arch. Then he recalls a wedding ceremony that took place in
                        the City Palace of ceremonies, handed over to the Red Cross. That day half of the room was
                        filled with "spouses relatives" in the red uniforms.

                        Maksym's fervent voice changes only at the very end, when we, about to say goodbye, started
                        talking of the Victory and how proudly and loudly we'd celebrate it all together.

                        “I really look forward to it,” he smiled a little sadly.
