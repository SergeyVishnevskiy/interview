                        Many now tell me “Great job!”, “You are a hero!”, but this is an exaggeration.

                        The fact that we were able to leave and saved ourselves is mostly good luck. We were lucky.

                        But there is one thing for which I can say "Good job!" to myself, that I rarely do. And this is
                        what I ask others to listen to: you must always remain a human being.

                        In Mariupol, I witnessed some really horrible things: some lacked a human face, did terrible
                        things, looted, stole, deceived, framed, betrayed their own friends.

                        My friend and her husband, who is Police high-ranking official, have left earlier. They knew
                        which way to leave, but they didn't tell anyone. I've always considered her a very close friend
                        of mine. But they did what they did. And I think it's dishonest.
